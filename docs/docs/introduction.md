# Introduction

Tooltips are a common UI pattern used to provide additional information to users. They are often used to explain the meaning of an icon or provide additional context for a specific element on a page.

`react-tooltip` is a powerful and flexible tooltip library for Roblox games. It allows you to easily add tooltips to your game with just a few lines of code. You can customize the appearance and behavior of your tooltips to fit your game's style and needs.

This library is a more flexible alternative to the [`@rbxts/react-tooltips`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/react-tooltips) library, which exposes a similar API without the extra features and customizability.

# Animated Tooltip

There are many ways to animate a tooltip in Roblox. These examples will show you how to create several different types of animations using `react-tooltip`.

We'll be using the `ripple` animation library to create these animations. You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @rbxts/ripple
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @rbxts/ripple
```

See the [Ripple documentation](https://github.com/littensy/ripple) for more examples of how to use the `ripple` library.
